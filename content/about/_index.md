Personal website of Clément Rebuffel, PhD student in Natural Language Generation.

This site is powered by [Hugo][1], which is supposedly _the world’s fastest framework for building websites_ and hosted by [Netlify][4]. It is based on the excellent [github-style][2] theme, which I have extended in a number of ways (for instance to support the Gallery). Speaking of, I have borrowed heavily from [CSS-Tricks][3] to build the Gallery. The icons for the Blog, Gallery and About sections are from [Flaticon][5]. Authors are [Freepik][7], [Pixel-Perfect][6] and [Freepik][7] respectively. :pray:

If you are interested in building something similar for yourself, the code is freely available on my [Github profile][8]. If you found a bug, please feel free to raise an issue and we'll investigate.

For any inquiry, job offer, good joke you want to share, etc. you can contact me by email or via one of the following plateform:
