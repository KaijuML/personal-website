This site is powered by [Hugo][1], which is supposedly the _The worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites_. It is based on the excellent [github-theme][2], which I have extended in a number of ways (for instance to support the Gallery). Speaking of, I have borrowed heavily from [CSS-Tricks][3] to build the Gallery. The website is hosted by [Netlify][4]. The icons for the Gallery and About sections are from [Flaticon][5]. Authors are [Pixel-Perfect][6] and [Freepik][7] respectively. :pray:

If you are interested in building something similar for yourself, the code is freely available on my [Github profile][8]. If you found a bug, please feel free to raise an issue and we'll investigate.

For any inquiry, job offer, good joke you want to share, etc. you can contact me by email or via the form below (soon to come).
