### A crazy scientist with a handsome beard

Some of you may have wondered: is this really a drawing of me? The resemblance is troubling, but it's not. How could it be? I am not a crazy scientist who does not sleep, although I do have a beard...

You're actually looking at Dr. Kreiger, from the 2009 TV series _[Archer][2]_. He's been characterized as _both friendly and possibly insane, [...] yet decent and good-natured at the same time_. Also, yes: he does look a lot like me, which is a big plus.
