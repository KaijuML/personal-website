# About Me

I am an **NLP Researcher**, and **Quant** at [**G-Research**](https://www.gresearch.co.uk/about/).

Before that, I did my **PhD** at **Sorbonne Universit√©**, while being a **Research Engineer** at **BNP Paribas**. My PhD, _Deep Learning for Data-to-Text Generation_ was done under the supervision of [Patrick Gallinari][1] and [Laure Soulier][2], from the [MLIA][3] team. All projects (solos \& duos) are available on [Github][4] and [ArXiv][5].

### Work

I work as a **Quant Researcher**, meaning I research **systematic trading ideas** to predict the future of financial markets, applying scientific techniques to find patterns in large, noisy and rapidly changing realworld data sets. In otherwords, I apply and develop state-of-the-art NLP approaches (read [_transformers_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)>)) to find trading signals in large textual corpora. By making computers do the trading, we remove human error and make sure only rigourously proven-to-work strategies are deployed.

Right now, I am interested in all things NLP:

- Learning representations & embeddings of sentence, entity, etc
- Large Language Models

Before that, I was a Research Engineer at BNP Paribas. In practice, I bridged the gap between research/academia and applications/enterprise, being part of the team which developped the internal company-wide search engine, as well as a number of other tools (translation plateform, document NLP, etc.).

### Academic Research

During my PhD, I worked on **Data-to-Text Generation** (DTG), i.e. building systems able to:

- comprehend complex structured data (e.g. tables, graphs, etc.);
- produce a fitting description (from one sentence to several paragraphs).

My PhD work has been focused on a critical aspect of DTG: **ensuring factualness in system outputs**.

### Hobbies

On a personal note, I am a climbing enthusiast and try to swim at least once per week. I greatly enjoy storytelling, both reading and going to the movies (used to go twice a week w/ movie pass before I moved to London). I'm also a fan of cooking: meals, deserts, as well as **cocktails** :tropical_drink: See the Gallery Section for some proof that I go outside!
