## About Me


I am a third year **PhD** student at **Sorbonne Universit√©**, and **Research Engineer** at **BNP Paribas**. My research includes all things **Natural Language Generation**, especially from structured data (e.g. tables, graphs, etc.). My work has focused both on encoding different modalities in order to learn better representations of complex data, as well as ensuring factualness in system outputs (constraining for factual outputs and evaluation of factualness).

I am a good thinker with a curious mind and a strong work ethic. In the last year of my PhD I have focused on working with other PhD students, with notably fruitful collaborations with University of Turin (Italy) and University of Aberdeen (UK). All projects (solos \& duos) are available on [github][1].


### Research

I am interested in **Data-to-Text Generation** (DTG), i.e. building systems able to:
 - comprehend complexe structured data; 
 - produce a fitting description. 

These systems are crucial in environements where raw data is abundent, but hardly usable as is (e.g. health, sports, etc.). End-users are more efficient when provided with textual summaries than structured data.

My PhD work has been focused on a critical aspect of DTG: **ensuring factualness in system outputs**. Descriptions which can be doubted and must be revised by human experts are less usefull that factual ones, even if some information is ommitted. As such, I have proposed novel encoding neural modules that are better suited for complex data, evaluation protocoles that can better discriminate between models, and training procedures that ensure models don't pick up on biased human behaviors (such as mentionning inverifiable facts).

### Work

I am a Research Engineer at BNP Paribas. In practice, I bridge the gap between research/academia and applications/enterprise. I am part of the team which developped the internal company-wide search engine, as well as a number of other tools (translation plateform, document NLP, etc.). I also act in an advisory capacity when I can: I have co-supervised an internship on Gramatical Error Correction, and helped write several of my coworkers' research papers (accepted at international conferences).

### Hobbies

On a personal note, I am a climbing enthusiast and used to run/swim at least once per week before COVID. I greatly enjoy storytelling, both reading and going to the movies (used to go twice a week w/ movie pass). I'm also a fan of cooking: meals, deserts, as well as **cocktails** :tropical_drink: See the Gallery Section for some proof that I go outside!
